 Time

Time allotted: 75 minutes total.
 
 Assignment:
---------------
 Need a C# program which will do sorting of two sets of 5 inputs and produce a single output of 10 values in ascending order.
 The first set of input will be numbers only (including negative numbers and decimals).
The second set will be characters A-J only (case insensitive). Each of the characters is assigned progressive values based on Fibonacci numbers. So here, A = 0; B = 1; C = 1; D = 2; E = 3; F = 5; G =8; H = 13; I = 21 and J = 34. No other characters are permitted.
 
 Rules:
--------
 No hard coding of values for C-J allowed. The values for each of these characters need to be derived using the relation: C = B+A; D = C+B … etc. Please note the values for A = 0 and B = 1 can be hardcoded.
 Need clean exception handling so any bad input is rejected correctly.
 Any kind of input entry format, as it works to your convenience, is allowed. It can be a single string with comma separated values or can be entry of one value at a time, etc.
 Use of in-built function(s) for sorting is acceptable.
 You are welcome to refer to internet or books and this is not viewed negatively. However, please give appropriate credits, if any such material was consulted.
 
 Sample Test:
----------------
 First Set:
 1
2
-1
0.5
5
 Second Set:
 A
D
E
H
b
 Output:
 -1
A
0.5
1
b
2
D
E
5
H
 Note: when the value equivalents are the same, the numerical value precedes the character; here 1 precedes b and 2 precedes D.
